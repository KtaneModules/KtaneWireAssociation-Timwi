    Fair warning: This module poses a difficult puzzle, but one that can only be solved
    once. The puzzle is to devise a strategy that always works. Once you know the
    strategy, you can solve the module easily. If you enjoy puzzles, do yourself a
    favor and try to solve it on your own before seeking spoilers from players who
    already know how to do it!
