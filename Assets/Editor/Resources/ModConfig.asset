    Fair warning: This module poses a difficult puzzle that can only be solved once.
    The puzzle is to devise a strategy that always works. Once you know a strategy,
    the module becomes easy. If you enjoy puzzles, do yourself a favor and try to
    solve it on your own before seeking spoilers from players who already know how
    to do it!
